So what has been added?
A directory structure including: images, includes, javascripts, stylesheets (sass and images within), and an index.php.

Images
Here you should store all your inline images for your website.

Includes
For any files that added to main files (index.php, abount.php, etc), such as a header, footer or sidebar. Within this directory is included a functions.php for storing needed php functions.

Javascripts
Your javascript files. Included is a base.js with Prototype/Scriptaculous specific code.

Stylesheets
Within this directory you will find another Images folder and a SASS folder.

Why another images folder? I prefer to store images called by my stylesheets store seperately from inline images. It's completely my preference and you need not follow this structure if you do not care to.

SASS? What the hell is SASS? Just the most wonderful thing to ever happen to CSS. Take some time to read up on it.

Index.php
Your standard index file. It includes a good amount of HTML5 standards and useful header meta tags and css/javascript links.
